# Optifine instances for MultiMC

## Changing Minecraft versions
If you want to change the Minecraft version, change the branch\
to the desired version. If the version you want isn't there, [Optifine](https://optifine.net/)\
probably hasn't been released yet.

## Downloading an instance
You can download the instance by going to the [releases page](https://github.com/MMCInstances/OptifineInstances/releases) and\
downloading a release. Each release will have a zip file named after\
the Minecraft version containing the instance.
